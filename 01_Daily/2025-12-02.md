Well... all of my files got deleted by LazyGit :). Thank the Lord one bright day I decided to do backups on my hard-drive or I would have lost a lot of those permanently. Only downside was losing a few days of dev journals, but even a lot of what I learned is still on Gemini. **Could've been farrr worse!!** Grateful to have learned this lesson sooner rather than later.
