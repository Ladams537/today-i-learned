## Python and Java -> everything is an object
Shelters you from learning a whole host of topics.

### You don't need to learn
1. Multiple incompatible object types
  * plain old data (POD) types
  * aggregates/structs
  * types with vtables
  * types without vtables
  * memory-layout guarantees
  * ownership traits that differ across types
2. Manual memory management
  * destructors
  * RAII
  * free() or delete
  * ownership/borrowing rules
  * lifetimes
  * pointer invalidation rules
3. Polymorphism implementation
  * virtual function tables
  * trait objects (Rust)
  * thin vs fat pointers
  * dynamic vs static dispatch
  * method dispatch cost differences
  * when polymorphism is allowed or not allowed
4. Memory layout design
  * field order matters
  * alignment matters
  * padding matters
  * move semantics matter
  * copy semantics matter
  * heap vs stack placement matters
5. Value categories
  * lvalues
  * rvalues
  * xvalues
  * prvalues
  * temporaries
  * references
  * moves
  * copies
6. Metaprogramming at the low-level
  * C++ template and **Rust's macros are incredibly powerful-->and extremely complex**
7. How containers store values
  * containers may store obkects inline
  * or pointers to objects
  * or relocate objects, invalidating references
  * or requre traits like `Copy`, `Clone`, `Move`
