How much more my microcontroller has that the one being used in the tutorial. A lot of extension work I would be able to do on his example if I so chose.

Easy to see why adding more hardware gets complicated real fast. You need systems to rank, prioritise, and compare each bit. Just like how going from 12-bit to 16-bit is not a small improvement, but a 16x one.

Vector table stores all the interrupt addresses that we have access to. Some have fixed priority levels; some can be configured.

DMA: (**direct memory access**) allows data transfers to happen in the background without the intervention of the CPU. Allows it to execute other tasks, only being interrupted when a whole data block is available for processing.
* A whole lot of parameters need configured when you are dealing with DMA
* Only one channel can be active at the same time in a stream
* Request mapping table shows you what you need to configure
* Arbiter used for handling DMA stream priority. If same level, hardware priority is used
* Circular mode: handling circular buffers; Normal mode: reaches zero and stream is disabled
* DMA FIFO allows data packing/unpacking and/or burst mode to be used -> saw this coming up in distributed-limit-order book 

The most important quality one can have is to see a problem and have a systematic way of going about solving issues. The most common type of problem you will encounter in life are unknown. They may follow a similar pattern to what you have seen before, but they will be new. You then have to slowly piece things together, research, and innovate new ways of solving it by joining tools together. Many problems can be solved with embedded systems. Just got to look. But then again, might be solved by another solution. Become a problem solver. Not a one-trick-pony.
