Constantly reminded of how powerful good class / structure design is in making clean, scalable, high-functioning code with quick ship times. Alongside this is how you name said classes.

Also the power of Empty Classes or Traits to define particular behaviour. Love a good abstraction. Much room for philosophy within designing big systems.

Reminded of what I heard from the NI Stripe CTO yesterday: **be meticulous in your craft** -> there is something you can't quantify when this is in your culture which makes a huge impact overall.
