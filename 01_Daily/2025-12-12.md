 ![[LoRaWAN Environmental Sensor]]
 Need to begin working on this. Learned a lot about just how stiff a breadboard can be when you initially buy it - praying I have not damaged my LoRa sensor or PICO. Difficult as I am tired, but I am aware the longer I procrastinate, the higher the friction to starting will be again. 


Ran into this same problem again today. Knew the method, but unfortunately did not remember exactly how to do it. Not great. But, we're getting better.
``` python
def two_sum(nums, target):
	prev_map = {}
	
	for i, num in enumerate(nums):
		diff = target - num
		
		if diff in prev_map:
			# returning the indexes
			return(prev_map[diff], i)
		
		prev_map[num] = i
```

A cool thing about python I learned today was that anything not wrapped in a function is run at start time. This creates unexpected behaviour
```python
multiplers = []

for i in range(3):
	multipliers.append(lambda x, i=i: x*i)
	
result = [m(5) for m in multiplers]
print(result)
```
If you did not add the i=i, you will print out [10, 10, 10] - cool!

Another one was that python for default arguments only evaluates them once, not every time you call the function. 
```python
def add_inventory(item, inventory=[]): inventory.append(item) return inventory print(add_inventory("Sword")) print(add_inventory("Shield")) print(add_inventory("Potion", [])) print(add_inventory("Map"))
```
Thus, this prints: 
`['Sword']` (Uses default)
`['Sword', 'Shield']` (Uses default)
`['Potion']` (**Uses new list provided by user**)
`['Sword', 'Shield', 'Map']` (Goes back to using the default)
