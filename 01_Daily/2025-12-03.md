In Go, `len s` gives you the number of **Bytes**, but `range s` gives you the **Runes** (characters). Range handles the weird UTF-8 stuff for us automatically. But when comparing anagrams length in the first place to see if valid, must use len(s) to keep granular version.

**Learning how to learn**

Doing loads of problems so that data structures become second nature. Did a problem perfect for a map (obvious key-value pair) and did not make use of it, causing the problem to be much longer even though the logic was right. Not a big deal in the specific instance, but important for next time.
Maps can be tricky to work with though. Match on the key, extract the value.
