## args and kwargs
* Star is doing the heavy lifting in this
* Only handles **positional** argument
* Star is what tells Python to pack everything extra into the object called "args"
* Collected into tuple

**kwargs
* allows for keyword collection
* collects extra arguments into a **dictionary**
* double-star does the work here. Parameter name does not matter

-> can combine these together to collect everything
-> must always place **positional** before **keyword** arguments
-> applies both to the function definition and calls

### * Operators
* in function definitions they pack 
* in function calls they unpack
